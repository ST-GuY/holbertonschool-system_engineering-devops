Application Server vs Web Server

This infrastructure uses multiple servers to separate responsibilities and improve availability.

A second load balancer (HAProxy) is added and configured as a cluster with the first one. This is done to avoid a single point of failure. If one load balancer fails, the other one can continue to handle traffic.

The components of the infrastructure are split across different servers:

-- The web server (Nginx) is responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving static content.

-- The application server runs the business logic of the application and processes dynamic requests.

-- The database server (MySQL) stores and manages the application data.

Separating these components allows each part of the infrastructure to scale independently and makes maintenance and troubleshooting easier. It also improves security by limiting the responsibilities of each server.
