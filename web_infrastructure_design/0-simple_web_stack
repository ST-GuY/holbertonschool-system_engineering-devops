Simple Web Stack (One Server)

A user wants to access the website www.foobar.com
.

When the user enters www.foobar.com
 in a web browser, a DNS server resolves the domain name to the IP address 8.8.8.8. The www record is a DNS A record that points to the server’s IP address.

The user’s computer then sends an HTTP request over the Internet to the server.

A server is a machine that hosts and delivers websites to users. This server contains all the components needed to run the website.

The web server (Nginx) receives HTTP requests from users and serves static content or forwards requests to the application server.

The application server runs the application logic and processes user requests.

The database (MySQL) stores the website data, and the application server reads and writes data from it.

The server communicates with the user’s computer using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.


Issues with this infrastructure

-- Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
If the server goes down, the website becomes unavailable.

-- Downtime during maintenance:
Restarting the server or deploying new code causes the website to be temporarily unavailable.

-- Limited scalability:
This infrastructure cannot handle a high volume of traffic because it uses only one server.
